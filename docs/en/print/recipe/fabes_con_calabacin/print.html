                    <p>You got us, most of what we eat is made by throwing almost the same ingredients into a huge pot. This kind of recipe is easy to cook, packed with a ton of veggies and protein from the beans, and a hearty alternative to high-carb dishes. They tick a lot of our boxes, like being free of animal products. But, hey, this one is fancier. It has wine in it!</p>
<p>The idea behind this recipe was emulating another Asturian classic: fabes con almejas, which is a white bean and clam stew. Ours is a simplified and veganized version (<a href="https://www.insidescience.org/news/why-wine-isnt-always-vegan">depending on the wine that you use</a>) that doesn’t need any seafood to float your boat. The cheapest white wine in the store will do the trick if you pair it with some delicious parsley.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 cups dry white beans or 3 (19 oz.) cans of cooked white beans</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves or as many as you can mince before you get tired</li>
<li>2 onions</li>
<li>2 medium or 3 small zucchini</li>
<li>Half a cup white wine</li>
<li>3 tablespoons chopped parsley (fresh or frozen)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or another vegetable oil if you are a heathen</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are using dry beans, leave them to soak in abundant cold water the night before. The day you are making the recipe, drain the remaining water, and reserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mince the garlic and onions. Heat the oil over medium in the biggest pot you have in your house, fry the garlic until it’s golden, and then add the onion. Stir occasionally until the onion is transparent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chop the zucchini in small pieces, add to the pot, stir and cook for about five minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pour in the wine, and delight yourself with its delicious aroma while drooling for a couple of minutes until the alcohol evaporates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the beans and the parsley and stir everything well. If you are using uncooked beans, add hot water until it fully covers the ingredients and then as much as fits without spilling over when it boils. This is because they will have to cook for a long time and they must be constantly covered in water, so it will save you having to top it up and bring it back to a boil every few minutes. If you are using pre-cooked or canned beans, add just enough water to cover the ingredients. Set heat to high until the water starts boiling, then lower back to medium.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook for at least an hour or until the stew thickens, and the beans are tender. Bear in mind that the stew will thicken even more after resting for a few hours. Salt to taste and serve.</p>
</li>
</ol>
