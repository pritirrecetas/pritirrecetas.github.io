      <description>You got us, most of what we eat is made by throwing almost the same ingredients into a huge pot. This kind of recipe is easy to cook, packed with a ton of veggies and protein from the beans, and a hearty alternative to high-carb dishes. They tick a lot of our boxes, like being free of animal products. But, hey, this one is fancier. It has wine in it!</description>

      <description>When Silvia was 18, her Monday home-from-school tradition was to cook a pot full of pasta and eat all of it plain while watching the latest Game of Thrones episode. Fortunately for us, both her palate and intestine have evolved greatly since then and, fortunately for humanity as a whole, Game of Thrones’ final season is but a vague collective memory today.
This pasta recipe is loosely inspired by the traditional bolognese, but it includes more vegetables and uses a vegan substitute for ground meat.</description>

      <title>Asturian white bean stew</title>

      <description>Both of us were born and raised in the Northwestern region of Spain called Asturias (no, not Galicia, but it rains a lot there too). Fabada is a dish that sums up the character of the region: working class, humble but strong. Now we don’t eat it as often because we have moved away, and since we are two nerds working from home instead of a mine, we can’t consume ridiculous amounts of fat without collapsing.</description>

      <title>Chickpea &amp; spinach stew</title>

      <description>This is a recipe we stole from Silvia’s mother. She used to make it for us when we moved in together and didn’t trust our ability to feed ourselves. Now it’s one of the comforting stews we prepare regularly during cold months. If all that green is putting you off, don’t worry! We swear this is a very tasty dish, and the gooeyness of cooked spinach can be toned down with a few tricks.</description>
