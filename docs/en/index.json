[{"categories":null,"contents":"Does this even qualify as a recipe? We think it does. At least it counts as a useful trick to rewrite the horror story printed on the packaging of microwave ‘poopcorn’. This recipe is almost as easy as pushing a couple of buttons and at least you’ll know exactly what you’re eating. It is easy to master and once you do, you will not be going back.\nIt was shamelessly plagiarized from a video by one of our absolute favourite content creators, the inimitable (heh, get it?) Brian David Gilbert. He made this video about the way he makes what he calls ‘pepcorn’, but we are not so brave (or should we say reckless?). Try it his way if you dare, or only with salt if you’re vanilla like us. He just inspired us, as he always does, to be our better selves and savour the corny things.\nBrian makes pepcorn in a wok covered with tinfoil, which sounds like a good idea, but we don’t have space to put a wok in our house. We use a not-comically-large pot with a lid. Some covering is necessary if you don’t want greasy corn all over your surfaces and orifices.\nYou may have noticed it’s the only recipe where we don’t use garlic… wait. Two words: garlic salt.\nIngredients  Half a cup corn kernels 1 tablespoon olive oil or another vegetable oil Fine salt Other seasoning if you’re feeling creative or reckless  Directions  Heat the oil in the pot over medium. Be careful not to overheat the oil. When it’s getting warm, add 2 or 3 kernels, and place the lid. When they pop, the oil is ready. Remove the popped kernels, feed them to whoever is hungrier, add the rest of the kernels, and place back the lid. With the help of oven mitts or a dishcloth, grab the pot while holding the lid in place, and shake it over the fire or stove. Repeat this frequently so the kernels don’t burn, but not too often so they don’t get too cold (channel your inner Goldilocks). If you have a ceramic or induction stove, be careful to pick up the pot before shaking it so you don’t scratch the cooktop. Let the kernels do their thing until the pops become less frequent. Then, turn off the heat and let them rest a minute (away from the stove) before taking the lid off. Our lid is transparent and we’ve perfected our calculations to maximize the amount of popcorn we can make in that pot. Half a cup of kernels yields a reasonable amount for two people if you manage to pop most of them (but we usually make a cheeky little more). It is time for you to go on your own adventure of pop-discovery. March forth and make us poproud. Salt to taste.

This kind of recipe is easy to cook, packed with a ton of veggies and protein from the beans, and a hearty alternative to high-carb dishes. They tick a lot of our boxes, like being free of animal products. But, hey, this one is fancier. It has wine in it!\nThe idea behind this recipe was emulating another Asturian classic: fabes con almejas, which is a white bean and clam stew. Ours is a simplified and veganized version (depending on the wine that you use) that doesn’t need any seafood to float your boat. The cheapest white wine in the store will do the trick if you pair it with some delicious parsley.\nIngredients  3 cups dry white beans or 3 (19 oz.) cans of cooked white beans 4 garlic cloves or as many as you can mince before you get tired 2 onions 2 medium or 3 small zucchini Half a cup white wine 3 tablespoons chopped parsley (fresh or frozen) 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or another vegetable oil if you are a heathen  Steps   If you are using dry beans, leave them to soak in abundant cold water the night before. The day you are making the recipe, drain the remaining water, and reserve.\n  Mince the garlic and onions. Heat the oil over medium in the biggest pot you have in your house, fry the garlic until it’s golden, and then add the onion. Stir occasionally until the onion is transparent.\n  Chop the zucchini in small pieces, add to the pot, stir and cook for about five minutes.\n  Pour in the wine, and delight yourself with its delicious aroma while drooling for a couple of minutes until the alcohol evaporates.\n  Add the beans and the parsley and stir everything well. If you are using uncooked beans, add hot water until it fully covers the ingredients and then as much as fits without spilling over when it boils. This is because they will have to cook for a long time and they must be constantly covered in water, so it will save you having to top it up and bring it back to a boil every few minutes. If you are using pre-cooked or canned beans, add just enough water to cover the ingredients. Set heat to high until the water starts boiling, then lower back to medium.\n  Cook for at least an hour or until the stew thickens, and the beans are tender. Bear in mind that the stew will thicken even more after resting for a few hours. Salt to taste and serve.\n  ","imageLink":"images/fabada-de-calabacin.jpeg","permalink":"https://pritirrecetas.github.io/en/recipe/fabes_con_calabacin/","tags":["vegan"],"title":"Bean \u0026 zucchini stew"},{"categories":null,"contents":"When Silvia was 18, her Monday home-from-school tradition was to cook a pot full of pasta and eat all of it plain while watching the latest Game of Thrones episode. Fortunately for us, both her palate and intestine have evolved greatly since then and, fortunately for humanity as a whole, Game of Thrones’ final season is but a vague collective memory today.\nThis pasta recipe is loosely inspired by the traditional bolognese, but it includes more vegetables and uses a vegan substitute for ground meat. Gabriel hopes that no former colleagues or flatmates come after his head if they read this. In the traditional bolognese, the meat is cooked in the sauce, but the day we make it we like to serve it with crispy plant-based ground “meat” straight from the pan. Afterwards, we store the leftovers with the sauce in one of the countless containers that Silvia bought after she awakened to the wonders of adulthood.\nIngredient-wise, you could use canned tomatoes, passata or tomato paste, but why not enjoy the good things in life and use fresh tomatoes. Zucchini is one of our favourite vegetables because of its versatility and its subtle flavour. We like to add it to our recipes for an extra dose of veggies, so we use it all year round, even though it’s in season only in summer. Shame, shame! Damnit, we brought Game of Thrones to our minds again.\nIngredients  4 garlic cloves or as many as you can mince before you get tired 1 onion 1 small zucchini (Optional) 1 celery stalk (Optional) 1 small carrot 2 tomatoes 250 g pasta of your choosing 200 g frozen vegan ground \u0026ldquo;meat\u0026rdquo; 1 tablespoon oregano 1 teaspoon paprika (you don\u0026rsquo;t have to use Pimentón de la Vera this time) 2 teaspoons garlic powder (Optional) Half a teaspoon of pepper 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (Optional) Grated cheese, for serving  Directions   Mince the garlic and onion. Heat half the oil over medium in a perfectly normal-sized pot and fry the garlic until it’s golden. Add the onion.\n  Cut the zucchini in small pieces and add it to the pot. Season with salt. Proceed analogously with the celery and/or carrot if you are using any. Stir occasionally.\n  While the vegetables are frying, fill a small pot with boiling water. Cut the tomatoes’ skin like this and put them in the boiling water for about 20 seconds. Remove them from the water and try to peel them without burning yourself. Discard the water in the small pot.\n  Cut the peeled tomatoes into chunks (the size doesn’t matter much since they will break apart later) and add them to the pot. Add oregano, paprika, one teaspoon of garlic powder and (optionally) pepper. Season with salt again. Let the sauce cook for about 30 minutes or at least until the tomatoes soften.\n  When the sauce is nearly done, cook the pasta following the instructions on the package and fry the vegan ground “meat” in a pan with one tablespoon of oil and the rest of the garlic powder.\n  (Optional) Blend the sauce if you prefer a more velvety texture\n  Serve and devour. We usually serve the pasta first, then the sauce and vegan ground “meat” at the end. You can also add shredded cheese on top if you want.

Fabada is a dish that sums up the character of the region: working class, humble but strong. Now we don’t eat it as often because we have moved away, and since we are two nerds working from home instead of a mine, we can’t consume ridiculous amounts of fat without collapsing. We also try to limit our intake of animal products to a minimum for ethical reasons, but we confess that when we visit home, our mothers cook fabada for us with all their love, and we reluctantly eat it with a pinch of guilt and a bunch of meat.\nOur modest veganized version inspired by the incredible vegan fabada from Casa Chema keeps the paprika flavour from the chorizo in the original version, and won’t make you fall into a food-induced coma afterwards! We can also share it with our friends who don’t eat pork or any animal products. If only we weren’t asocial nerds.\nWe could get fancy about the kind of beans to use and how to prepare them, but we don’t care. They will taste good. However, we strongly recommend using pimentón de la Vera, a type of smoked paprika from la Vera region in Spain that we have found in the spice aisle of supermarkets even in Canada. You may be tempted to use any smoked paprika but if you do, you will be cooking a different dish.\nIngredients  3 cups dry white beans or 3 (19 oz.) cans of cooked white beans 2 onions 1 orange bell pepper 500 g diced squash (frozen or fresh) 4 garlic cloves or as many as you can mince before you get tired 1 tablespoon de la Vera smoked paprika (it has to be pimentón de la Vera or it won’t taste the same, we can’t stress this enough) 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or another vegetable oil if you are a heathen  Directions   If you are using dry beans, leave them to soak in abundant cold water the night before. The day you are making the recipe, drain the remaining water, and reserve.\n  Mince the garlic and onions. Heat half the oil (two tablespoons) over medium in the biggest pot you have in your house, fry (Gabriel refuses to use distorted French expressions) half the garlic until it’s golden, and then add the onion. Most people seem to add the garlic with or after the onion, but to us that’s just wrong. We want our garlic crispy and flavourful, you do you. Stir occasionally until the onion is transparent.\n  Chop the bell pepper in small pieces, add to the pot, and stir. After that, add the diced squash and stir.\n  In a small pan, heat the other half of the oil over medium, and fry the other half of garlic until golden. Then, add the paprika (pimentón de la Vera, last warning) and cook it for a few seconds so that it doesn’t burn. When it’s done, add it to the pot with the vegetables. You may ask why we don’t cook it all in the pot. We don’t know why, but it tastes so much better this way. We call it magic, but perhaps we should call someone who actually knows about cooking.\n  Mix the vegetables with the garlicky, papriky oil, add the beans and stir them well. If you are using uncooked beans, add hot water until it fully covers the ingredients and then as much as fits without spilling over when it boils. This is because they will have to simmer for a long time and they must be constantly covered in water, so it will save you having to top it up and bring it back to a boil every few minutes.

She used to make it for us when we moved in together and didn’t trust our ability to feed ourselves. Now it’s one of the comforting stews we prepare regularly during cold months. If all that green is putting you off, don’t worry! We swear this is a very tasty dish, and the gooeyness of cooked spinach can be toned down with a few tricks.\nWe buy dry legumes in order to reduce the amount of cans and trash we produce, but cooked bean cans work just fine and halve the cooking time. We won’t judge you because, on the other hand, we use frozen spinach for convenience.\nIngredients  3 cups dry chickpeas or 3 (19 oz.) cans of cooked chickpeas 300 g frozen whole leaf spinach (use less or chopped spinach if you are not a fan of goo) 2 onions 4 garlic cloves or as many as you can mince before you get tired 1 tablespoon de la Vera smoked paprika (it has to be pimentón de la Vera or it won’t taste the same, we can’t stress this enough) 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or another vegetable oil if you are a heathen  Directions   (TL;DR: Get cooked chickpeas) If you are using dry chickpeas, leave them to soak in abundant warm water the night before. The day you are making the recipe, drain the remaining water, and boil the chickpeas in a pot of clean water with no salt for at least one hour or until they are tender. In the few minutes after they start boiling, a mysterious foam will start to emerge. This is called scum or aquafaba, depending on who you ask. We haven’t tried this, but apparently it can be used to replace egg whites (if you have any good recipes that use it, share them with us!) because of their texture and protein content or whatnot. You can use it or throw it away, but either way, scoop it off your boiling chickpeas. When they are done, drain the water and reserve.\n  Mince the garlic and onions. Heat half the oil (two tablespoons) over medium in the biggest pot you have in your house, fry half the garlic until it’s golden, and then add the onion.
