      <description>Both of us were born and raised in the Northwestern region of Spain called Asturias (no, not Galicia, but it rains a lot too). This dish sums up the character of the region: working class, humble but strong. Now we have moved away, and since we are two nerds working from home instead of a mine, we canâ€™t consume ridiculous amounts of fat without collapsing. We also try to limit our intake of animal products to a minimum for ethical reasons, but we confess that when we visit home, our mothers cook fabada for us with all their love, and we reluctantly eat it with a pinch of guilt and a lot of pork.</description>
