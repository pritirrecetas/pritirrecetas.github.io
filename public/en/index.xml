      <description>Both of us were born and raised in the Northwestern region of Spain called Asturias (no, not Galicia, but it rains a lot there too). Fabada is a dish that sums up the character of the region: working class, humble but strong. Now we don’t eat it as often because we have moved away, and since we are two nerds working from home instead of a mine, we can’t consume ridiculous amounts of fat without collapsing.</description>

      <description>This is a recipe we stole from Silvia’s mother. She used to make it for us when we moved in together and didn’t trust our ability to feed ourselves. Now it’s one of the comforting stews we prepare regularly during cold months. If all that green is putting you off, don’t worry! We swear this is a very tasty dish, and the gooeyness of cooked spinach can be toned down with a few tricks.</description>

      <description>Hi! We are Silvia and Gabriel, and, like we told the border officer in the cheesiest voice possible the first time we arrived in Canada, we’re a couple! Originally from Northern Spain, now residing in Ontario, and eventually who knows. We are definitely not professional chefs, only two people who try to eat healthy and enjoy tasting and making up new recipes. Besides that, Silvia is a PhD student in Computer Science and Gabriel works in video game translation as a freelancer and teacher.</description>
