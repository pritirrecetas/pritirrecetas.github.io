Welcome to the newest installment of *Silvia and Gabriel offend entire cultures*. It's like Sheldon and Amy's *Fun with Flags*, but somehow more awkward and with food at the end.

We try not to eat meat, Gabriel doesn't enjoy food that is too spicy (blah blah "why would I want my insides to feel like they're on fire" something something) and Silvia is *one of those people* for whom cilantro tastes like soap (in a bad way), so we don't often go to Mexican restaurants. But here's the problem: we *really* like Mexican food. So we've spent the past few years trying different ingredients and spices and converged on this vegan, vegetable-packed, tasty fajita recipe. 

By construction, this recipe is not, does not claim to be, and does not want to be anything but *very loosely inspired* by real Mexican food. If you want to learn Mexican cuisine, please look elsewhere. As a general rule, if you want to know about anything Mexico, do not ask a Spaniard. While we share a lot with our Mexican comrades, we respect them too much to claim to speak for them.

This recipe is a great opportunity to use almost any leftover vegetables that you have lying around, so don't feel free to mix things up. The only thing to be careful of is the tomato-to-other-vegetables proportion, which shouldn't venture off too far if you want to avoid too dry or too liquidy filling. We strongly recommend using the crunchier *corn* tortillas (as opposed to wheat ones) due to what we affectionally call *the CRONCH factor*.

## Ingredientes

- 3 garlic cloves
- 1 onion
- 1 small zucchini
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 tomato
- 200 g frozen vegan ground "meat"
- 1 tablespoon cumin
- Half a teaspoon of paprika
- Half a teaspoon of garlic powder
- One quarter teaspoon of oregano
- (Optional) One quarter teaspoon of pepper
- 8 corn "tortillas"
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- (Optional) Grated cheese, for serving (Monterrey Jack is recommended)

## Pasos

1. Mince the garlic and onion. Heat half the oil over medium in a perfectly normal-sized pot (or a big frying pan) and fry the garlic until it’s golden. Add the onion, and fry until translucent.

2. Cut the zucchini and red bell pepper in small pieces and add it to the pot. Season with salt. Let the vegetables cook for around 15 minutes or until the zucchini loses its white color and becomes somewhat translucent, stirring occasionally.

3. Cut the tomato in small pieces (do not peel it) and add it to the pot. Salt to taste and stir. Add cumin, paprika, oregano, pepper and half of the garlic powder and stir again. Salt to test and let the ingredients cook together for about 30 minutes over medium heat.

3. Pica el tomate (sin pelar) y añádelo a la olla. Sala al gusto y remueve. Echa el comino, pimentón, orégano, pimienta y la mitad del ajo en polvo y remueve de nuevo. Sala al gusto y deja que se cocine todo junto a fuego medio durante 30 minutos.

4. When the sauce is nearly done, fry the vegan ground “meat” in a pan with one tablespoon of oil and the rest of the garlic powder. Once it's fried and crunchy, add it to the pot with the rest of the ingredients and stir to let all the filling's flavours blend for one or two minutes.

6. In a small pan, heat the corn "tortillas" one by one until they are crunchy on both sides but not burnt. When you turn them over, you can add the shredded cheese on top so that it melts if you so choose. Remove the "tortillas" from the pan and add the filling. Now, stand and observe a minute of silence for the 130 million Mexican people whom we have just insulted... and enjoy!
