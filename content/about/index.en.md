Hi! We are Silvia and Gabriel, and, like we told the border officer in the cheesiest voice possible the first time we arrived in Canada, weâ€™re a couple! Originally from Northern Spain, now residing in Ontario, and eventually who knows. We are definitely not professional chefs, only two people who try to eat healthy and enjoy tasting and making up new recipes. Besides that, Silvia is a [PhD student](https://www.silviasellan.com) in Computer Science and Gabriel works in video game translation as a freelancer and teacher.
